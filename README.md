# C++ Project Template

This project template is designed to help you set up a C++ 14 project using CMake. The template is minimal yet flexible, allowing you to add libraries and expand your project as needed.
Project Structure

The structure of the project is as follows:

```structure
Project/
├── CMakeLists.txt      # CMake build configuration
├── include/            # Directory for header files
│   ├── library/        # Optional directory for library headers
│   └── include.hpp     # Example header file
├── src/                # Directory for source files
│   ├── library/        # Optional directory for library sources
│   └── main.cpp        # Main program file
├── tests/              # Directory for test files
├── build/              # Build directory created after running CMake
└── cmake/              # directory for CMake scripts
```

## Key Folders

- `include/`: Contains all your header files (.hpp). You can organize headers for different libraries into subdirectories within include/library/ if necessary.

- `src/`: Contains all your source files (.cpp). You can organize source files for different libraries into subdirectories within src/library/.

- `cmake/`: This directory can store additional CMake configuration files.
- `tests/`: (Optional) Contains all test files

## How to Configure and Build the Project

1. Clone the repository (or set up your project using this template):

   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd <your-project-directory>
   ```

2. Create a build directory (to keep the build files separate from your source files):

   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ```

3. Run CMake to configure the project:

   ```bash
   cmake ..
   ```

   This command will configure the build system and generate the necessary files for your platform (Makefiles for Linux/macOS, Visual Studio project files for Windows, etc.).

4. Build the project:

   ```bash
   cmake --build .
   ```

   This command compiles the project using the build system generated by CMake.

5. Run the executable:

   After building, you'll have an executable in the build directory (e.g., main or main.exe depending on your OS). You can run it directly:

   ```bash
       ./main     # Linux/macOS
       main.exe   # Windows
   ```

> [!NOTE]
> You can use cmake extension in vscode for building and running the project it gets the job done.

## CMake Configuration

Here is a breakdown of the `cmake/config.cmake`:

```cmake
# Project configuration

set(PROJECT_NAME "PROJECT_NAME" CACHE STRING "Name of the project")
set(MYPROJECT_VERSION "1.0.0" CACHE STRING "Version of the project")

# C++ Standard
set(MYPROJECT_CXX_STANDARD 14 CACHE STRING "C++ standard for the project")
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD ${MYPROJECT_CXX_STANDARD})
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)

# Option to enable or disable testing
option(ENABLE_TESTING "Enable testing support" ON)

# Define GoogleTest version
set(GTEST_VERSION "v1.15.2" CACHE STRING "Version of GoogleTest to fetch")

```

### Key Points

- `set(PROJECT_NAME  "PROJECT_NAME")` : Set your project name.
- `option(ENABLE_TESTING ON)` : Set if you will use tests or not `ON` for true `OFF` for false.

### Customizing the Project

#### Add More Libraries

You can add other librarys to your project in the `cmake/Libraries.cmake` file you just have to library name and its path in

Format: <library_name> <source_directory>

```cmake
set(PROJECT_LIBRARIES
    "library" "src/library"
    # Add more libraries as needed
)
```
