# C++ Project Template

This project template is designed to help you set up a C++ 14 project using CMake. The template is minimal yet flexible, allowing you to add libraries and expand your project as needed.
Project Structure

The structure of the project is as follows:

```
Project/
├── CMakeLists.txt      # CMake build configuration
├── include/            # Directory for header files
│   ├── library/        # Optional directory for library headers
│   └── include.hpp     # Example header file
├── src/                # Directory for source files
│   ├── library/        # Optional directory for library sources
│   └── main.cpp        # Main program file
├── tests/              # Directory for test files
├── build/              # Build directory created after running CMake
└── cmake/              # Optional directory for CMake scripts (optional)
```

## Key Folders:

- `include/`: Contains all your header files (.hpp). You can organize headers for different libraries into subdirectories within include/library/ if necessary.

- `src/`: Contains all your source files (.cpp). You can organize source files for different libraries into subdirectories within src/library/.

- `cmake/`: (Optional) This directory can store additional CMake configuration files.
- `tests/`: (Optional) Contains all test files

## How to Configure and Build the Project

1. Clone the repository (or set up your project using this template):

   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd <your-project-directory>
   ```

2. Create a build directory (to keep the build files separate from your source files):

   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ```

3. Run CMake to configure the project:

   ```bash
   cmake ..
   ```

   This command will configure the build system and generate the necessary files for your platform (Makefiles for Linux/macOS, Visual Studio project files for Windows, etc.).

4. Build the project:

   ```bash
   cmake --build .
   ```

   This command compiles the project using the build system generated by CMake.

5. Run the executable:

   After building, you'll have an executable in the build directory (e.g., main or main.exe depending on your OS). You can run it directly:

   ```bash
       ./main     # Linux/macOS
       main.exe   # Windows
   ```

> [!NOTE]
> You can use cmake extension in vscode for building and running the project it gets the job done.

## CMake Configuration

Here is a breakdown of the `CMakeLists.txt`:

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)

set(PROJECT_NAME "PROJECT_NAME") # Replace with your actual project name
project(${PROJECT_NAME})

# Set C++ standard
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 14)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)

# Add the include directory to the project
include_directories(include)

# Collect all header files in the include directory
file(GLOB HEADER_FILES "include/*.hpp" "include/library/*.hpp")

# Collect all source files in the src directory
file(GLOB SRC_FILES "src/*.cpp" "src/library/*.cpp")

# Optionally, set up a library (if you have one)
add_library(my_library ${SRC_FILES} ${HEADER_FILES})

# Create an executable for the main program
add_executable(main "src/main.cpp")

# Link the library to the main executable
target_link_libraries(main my_library)

# Enable testing
enable_testing()

# Optionally include the tests subdirectory
add_subdirectory(tests)
```

### Key Points:

- `include_directories()`: Adds the include folder to the project, where header files are located.

- `file(GLOB ...)`: Collects all header files in the include/ directory. You can add library directories like include/library/ as needed.

- `add_executable()`: Defines the main executable for the project using src/main.cpp.

- `add_library()` and `target_link_libraries()`: These lines are commented out in the template but can be used to add and link libraries to the executable.

### Customizing the Project

- Add More Libraries: You can add additional libraries by organizing files in the `include/library/` and `src/library/` directories, and uncommenting the `add_library()` and `target_link_libraries()` sections in `CMakeLists.txt`.

- Modify the Project Name: Replace `"PROJECT_NAME"` in `CMakeLists.txt` with the actual name of your project.
